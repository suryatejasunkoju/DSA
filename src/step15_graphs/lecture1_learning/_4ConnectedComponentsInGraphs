Single graph can have multiple connected components.

For every graph traversal algorithm, we have to use visited[] because traverseAlgorithm(node1) will only traverse that component only.
Other components would be left out. To avoid this, we use visited[] and find out for which indices visited[i] is false and
then start traversing that components.
