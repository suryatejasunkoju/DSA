Two types of graphs:

1)Directed:
If Directed Graph has at-least one cycle, then it's called Directed Cyclic Graph(DAG).
Example:

For Directed Graphs,
Indegree of a node:- is the number of incoming edges.
Outdegree of a node:- is the number of outgoing edges.

2)Undirected:
If Undirected Graph has at-least one cycle, then it's called Undirected Cyclic Graph.
Example:

For undirected graphs,
Degree:- is the number of edges attached to a node.
Property:- Total Degree of a graph = 2 x Edges






Path in a Graph:
The path contains a lot of nodes and each of them is reachable and doesn't have duplicate nodes.
Example:
Consider the given graph,
https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DgZLJ9dhn39Y1Mi4lUQTGRFHtWIOq2Dc6vDlAoCr7KG9RgPpIe26dhbdZV3IpvkwrajaXlu1TuTUWa7YRI5OiGDhTqowOkjCLe9qP7bUPW8G4Hqn01DR9SqXr0zMQNj7rA72TEQAz8PFpcA59F65gwc
1 2 3 5 is a path.
1 2 3 2 1 is not a path, because a node canâ€™t appear twice in a path.
1 3 5 is not a path, as adjacent nodes must have an edge and there is no edge between 1 and 3.

Cost of Edge (or) Edge Weight:
A graph may have weights assigned on its edges. If weights are not assigned then we assume the unit(1) weight.
